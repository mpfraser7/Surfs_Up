The purpose of this analysis is to verify if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. To do so, we will look at the temperature for the month of June and December.

-The average temperature is above 72 which makes it ideal for the surf and ice cream shop business to stay open
-The lowest temperature is 64 which isn't very cold. The shops could stay open even on a bad day.


Here are the results for the month of December.

-The average is just below 72, but it's still decent if this is the coldest month of the year. 
-The lowest temperature is 56, which is a bit chilly for surfing and ice cream.
-The business might have to close on colder days.

## Summary
In conclusion, the surf and ice cream shop business could stay open year-round. The average temperature for both June and December are close to 72.
Both months will see hot days where the temperature is above 80, making it an ideal day for surfing or ice cream. The standard deviation is below 4
for both months. The temperature is stable enough to plan properly. To further analyze these two months, I would write a query to see if either
December or June gets more rain and thunderstorms. This type of weather could heavily impact the decision making. Also, I'd write a query to
see which month gets more daylight. Surfing can only be conducted when the sun is up.
